===== CASABLANCA =====
==== Aranel Surion <aranel@aranelsurion.org ====

Casablanca is a small, PHP-based, password-protected administration dashboard to keep track of your Raspberry. 
It's based on Atouk 's *awesome* PiWWW script.

== IMPORTANT ==
* After you upload Casablanca to your Pi, modify the phpChart_lite/conf.php to and set it's path accordingly, otherwise it won't work.
* To set a new password, modify index.php and change the MD5 there, sorry, had no time to prettify it.
* GPIO pins module requires WiringPi to be exist on your installation. It may already if you're using Raspbian or it's derivatives.

** Some features requires access to /var/lib/php5, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages and super-user privileges to use vcgencmd.
** If you don't want to use them, edit the script accordingly. If you want them, edit your sudoers file by issuing "sudo visudo"
** Under no circumstances, DO NOT give ALL priviliges to www-data user, only give it enough permissions to read/write above
** 3 files and execute /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd

** This script was meant to be used under Raspbian or Raspbmc. Some features may not work under other distributions.

== WARNING ==
This script makes heavy use of shell_exec() and requires extra privileges to run some modules, please be aware that this may lead
to very, very bad situations. If possible, check it line-by-line and find/report it's security holes. Do not run it on a unsafe
environment.
